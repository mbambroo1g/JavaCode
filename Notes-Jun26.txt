Jasmine
Mocha
Chai
Qunit/Test unit

Jasmine is for unit testing - unit testing bridges the gap between tech n non tech people.

What is this recording?
Jasmine is avaialble in github.

fn1(){
}

fn2(){
}

Behavior Driven Development
Spec test - GWT format
Given 
When
Then

Jasmine will connect Function testing with spec/use case

mocha = wrapper
chai= core of mocha which actually tests.

Qunit is very light.
Jasmine is most widely used for testing.

\\\
Every test cae must be inside a suite.

function fn(){
	console.log("Hello.")
}
function fn1(){
	console.log("Hello1"}

callback function - function executes when ready. This is called promise.

promise - the function when ready called itself. This is called promise.
When the function is loaded, it does something. If its not loaded, theree would still be a fail behavior.

describe as a function takes two params.

describe("statement", fn()); - if fn() is not loaded,l it will fail.


describe("statement", function(){
	it("some statement", function(){
	expect(true).toBe(true);
	});
);}

it is a function - expect is actual,
to be is actual.

beforeEach - exceutred before each test case.
before all - executed before any test case is executed, called only once.

after each - called after each test case is executed. Good fo reserting things insidea  suite.
after all - called at the end of suite. only once.


expect(null),toBe(undefined)-- ask

Jasmine allows a custom matcher.

--SELENIUM--


Phantomjs is a browser which is not viewable.
cucumber/gerkin
selenium supports browsers which are not viewable. continually tests web applications.

Selenium IDE- record n run (only in firefox)
Selenium RC server - local server (depracated)
Selenium WebDriver - writing robust test scripts
Selenium Grid - various enviroments. clones test cases for different enviroments. Could be used for SMDU UI.

--GRID is only configuration for server . DevOps will help perform this job.

record n replaY - QTP had such a thing.
-----
Webdriver first

we will use eclipse.
